# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-24)

**Core value:** Character identity must feel mechanically distinct — 90 subclasses play differently, not just look different
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Patrol, Commands, and Flight Paths

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Patrol, Commands, and Flight Paths)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-24 — Roadmap created from requirements and research

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: none yet

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phase 4 (fingerprints) gates Phase 5 (abilities) — no ability can be authored before all 10 domain mechanical verbs are locked in a design document
- Roadmap: Phase 3 (GUI builder) gates Phase 7 (content) — all zone content authored through builder, not hand-coded
- Roadmap: Phase 2 (OOB publisher) gates Phase 3 (desktop client) — typed envelope protocol defined before any client event handler is written
- Research: Use single CmdUseAbility dispatcher for all 360+ abilities; never per-ability Cmd classes
- Research: Two-pass area loading fix (BLD-06) must ship in Phase 3 before any cross-zone content is authored

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 risk: 90 subclass ability authoring is a creative design task (not pure engineering) — fingerprint document from Phase 4 is the only guard rail; budget extra time
- Phase 6 risk: Evennia contrib cooldowns persistence across disconnects is unverified — confirm during Phase 6 planning before combat is designed around it
- Phase 2 risk: Full Evennia OOB outputfunc catalog is MEDIUM-confidence — verify against webclient.py source before locking the typed protocol in Phase 2
